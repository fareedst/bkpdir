# Documentation Synchronization Framework

## Purpose
Ensure all documentation layers remain synchronized during specification and code changes.

## Synchronization Checkpoints

### Before Any Change
1. **Identify Affected Features**: Use feature matrix to find all related components
2. **Lock Documentation**: Prevent concurrent documentation changes
3. **Create Change Branch**: All documentation changes in single branch
4. **Impact Assessment**: Document which layers will be affected

### During Change Implementation
1. **Parallel Updates**: Update all affected documents simultaneously
2. **Consistency Validation**: Check cross-references after each document update
3. **Incremental Testing**: Validate changes don't break existing links
4. **Preview Generation**: Generate documentation preview to check formatting

### After Change Completion
1. **Full Validation**: Run complete validation checklist
2. **Cross-Reference Check**: Verify all links still work
3. **Feature Matrix Update**: Update completion status
4. **Test Alignment**: Ensure tests match documentation

## Automation Framework

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for orphaned references before commit
docs/scripts/validate-references.sh

# Ensure feature matrix is up to date
docs/scripts/check-feature-matrix.sh

# Validate cross-document consistency
docs/scripts/consistency-check.sh
```

### Validation Scripts
```bash
# docs/scripts/validate-references.sh
# Check that all TestXXX references point to real tests
# Check that all feature IDs are properly formatted
# Check that all links resolve correctly

# docs/scripts/check-feature-matrix.sh  
# Ensure all features in docs appear in matrix
# Verify implementation status is current
# Check for missing test coverage

# docs/scripts/consistency-check.sh
# Compare feature descriptions across documents
# Check for terminology drift
# Validate status code consistency
```

## Change Templates

### New Feature Template
```markdown
## Checklist for Adding [FEATURE-ID]

### Documentation Updates Required:
- [ ] specification.md - Add user-facing behavior description
- [ ] requirements.md - Add implementation requirements with traceability  
- [ ] architecture.md - Add technical implementation details
- [ ] testing.md - Add comprehensive test coverage requirements
- [ ] feature-tracking.md - Add feature to matrix with all references
- [ ] immutable.md - Add if this creates new immutable requirements

### Cross-Reference Updates:
- [ ] Update related features in feature-tracking.md
- [ ] Add backward compatibility notes if needed
- [ ] Update decision records if implementation choices were made
- [ ] Add to validation scripts if new validation is needed

### Implementation Tracking:
- [ ] Code will be marked with `// [FEATURE-ID]: Description` tokens
- [ ] Tests will reference [FEATURE-ID] in documentation
- [ ] Status codes (if any) added to configuration
- [ ] Error messages (if any) added to configuration
```

### Feature Modification Template  
```markdown
## Checklist for Modifying [FEATURE-ID]

### Impact Assessment:
- [ ] Check if feature is in immutable.md (requires version bump if yes)
- [ ] Identify dependent features using feature-tracking.md
- [ ] Assess backward compatibility impact
- [ ] Document migration path if breaking change

### Documentation Updates:
- [ ] Update all documents that reference this feature
- [ ] Maintain consistency of examples across documents
- [ ] Update test requirements to match new behavior
- [ ] Update decision records if implementation approach changed

### Validation:
- [ ] Run consistency checks on all updated documents
- [ ] Verify all cross-references still work
- [ ] Check that test coverage still matches requirements
- [ ] Validate that examples still work
```

## Conflict Resolution

### When Documents Disagree
1. **Immutable Specification**: Always takes precedence
2. **Specification vs Requirements**: Specification defines user experience, requirements define implementation
3. **Requirements vs Architecture**: Requirements define what, architecture defines how
4. **Architecture vs Testing**: Testing validates architecture implementation

### Resolution Process
1. Identify which document type should be authoritative for this conflict
2. Update the non-authoritative document to match
3. Add cross-reference to prevent future conflicts
4. Update validation scripts to catch this type of conflict
