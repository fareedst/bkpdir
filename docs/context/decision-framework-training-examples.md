## 🔧 Intermediate Decision Cases

### **Scenario 4: Conflicting Priorities**

**Context**: Multiple critical tasks available during extraction phase

**Raw Request**: "We have EXTRACT-002 (error handling), REFACTOR-006 (validation), and TEST-INFRA-002 (disk space testing) all marked as critical. Which should I work on first?"

**Decision Framework Application**:

#### **Analysis Process**:
```
1. 📋 Check Current Project Phase
   Current Phase: Component Extraction (from feature-tracking.md)
   Phase Critical: EXTRACT-XXX tasks take priority

2. 🔗 Analyze Dependency Chains
   EXTRACT-002: Blocks EXTRACT-003, 004, 005 (high impact)
   REFACTOR-006: Blocks final extraction readiness (medium impact)
   TEST-INFRA-002: Improves testing but doesn't block extraction (low impact)

3. 🎯 Consider Strategic Impact
   EXTRACT-002: Foundation work, enables multiple other extractions
   REFACTOR-006: Quality improvement, less critical for extraction
   TEST-INFRA-002: Infrastructure work, can be done in parallel later

4. 🤖 Evaluate Complexity
   EXTRACT-002: Well-planned with REFACTOR-004 prep work
   REFACTOR-006: Complex validation integration
   TEST-INFRA-002: Independent testing infrastructure
```

**Priority Resolution**:
```
Phase Critical: EXTRACT-002 ✅
High Dependency Impact: EXTRACT-002 ✅  
Low Complexity Risk: EXTRACT-002 ✅
Foundation Work: EXTRACT-002 ✅
```

```

**Decision Outcome**: **Hybrid Approach**
1. Create CFG-007 "Configuration validation system" as NEW FEATURE
2. Plan small MODIFICATIONS to CFG-001, CFG-002, CFG-003 for integration
3. Implement CFG-007 first, then integrate with existing features

**Implementation Plan**:
1. NEW FEATURE Protocol for CFG-007
2. MODIFICATION Protocol for each affected feature
3. Coordinate changes to ensure clean integration
4. Test end-to-end validation functionality

**Learning Points**:
- Complex changes often require multiple features
- Framework helps decompose complex requests
- NEW FEATURE for major functionality, MODIFICATION for integration
- Coordination planning prevents integration conflicts

### **Scenario 6: Quality vs Speed Trade-off**

**Context**: Urgent request to implement feature with relaxed quality requirements

- Achieve >90% test coverage
```

**Learning Points**:
- Safety gates are never negotiable
- Quality thresholds can be temporarily relaxed with explicit debt plan
- Framework allows thoughtful trade-offs with clear recovery path
- Technical debt must be explicitly tracked and scheduled

## 🚀 Advanced Complex Scenarios

### **Scenario 7: Architecture Decision with Multiple Valid Approaches**

**Context**: Implementing error handling system (EXTRACT-002) with multiple architectural options

**Raw Request**: "For EXTRACT-002, we could use interface-based errors, inheritance-based errors, or functional error handling. Which approach should we use?"

**Decision Framework Application**:

#### **Architectural Analysis Process**:
```
1. 🏗️ Extraction Requirements Analysis
   Interface-based: ✅ Supports dependency injection, clean boundaries
   Inheritance-based: ❌ Creates tight coupling, harder to extract
   Functional: ❓ Clean but may not fit existing patterns

2. 🔮 Future Impact Assessment
   Reusability Goals:
   - Interface-based: High reusability across different applications
   - Inheritance-based: Limited reusability due to tight coupling
   - Functional: High reusability but paradigm shift required

   Extraction Compatibility:
   - Interface-based: Excellent, clean package boundaries
   - Inheritance-based: Poor, creates circular dependencies
   - Functional: Good, but inconsistent with existing codebase

3. 🔧 Existing Codebase Patterns
   Current: Mix of interface-based and some inheritance
   Trend: Moving toward interface-based (REFACTOR-001-006)
   Goal: Component extraction readiness
```

**Framework Decision Process**:
```
1. 📑 Scope Boundaries Validation
   ✅ EXTRACT-002 explicitly planned for error handling extraction
   ✅ REFACTOR-004 prepared error handling standardization
   ✅ Architecture patterns documented for extraction goals

2. 🎯 Goal Alignment Assessment
   Component Extraction: Interface-based scores highest
   Reusability: Interface-based supports multiple contexts
   Consistency: Interface-based aligns with refactoring direction
   Future Work: Interface-based enables other extractions

3. 📊 Quality Impact Analysis
   Test Coverage: Interface-based easier to mock and test
   Error Patterns: Interface-based provides clear contracts
   Performance: Minimal difference between approaches
   Maintainability: Interface-based wins due to clear boundaries
```

**Decision Outcome**: **Interface-based error handling**

**Implementation Strategy**:
```
1. Define ErrorInterface contract
2. Create ApplicationError type implementing interface
3. Implement error classification system
4. Create factory functions for common error types
5. Maintain backward compatibility through adapter pattern
6. Document patterns in architecture.md
```

**Decision Documentation**:
```
Rationale: Interface-based approach best supports extraction goals
Trade-offs: Slightly more complex setup, but better long-term architecture
Alternatives Considered: Inheritance (coupling issues), Functional (paradigm shift)
Success Criteria: Clean extraction, high reusability, maintained backward compatibility
```

**Learning Points**:
- Framework guides architectural decisions toward project goals
- Multiple valid approaches require systematic evaluation
- Long-term goals (extraction) trump short-term convenience
- Decision rationale should be documented for future reference

### **Scenario 8: Emergency Feature Request During Refactoring**

**Context**: Critical bug discovered during REFACTOR-002 that requires immediate attention

**Raw Request**: "We found a critical bug in the formatter that's causing data corruption. We need to fix this immediately, but we're in the middle of refactoring formatter.go. What should we do?"

**Decision Framework Application**:

#### **Emergency Assessment**:
```
1. 🚨 Criticality Validation
   Impact: Data corruption (critical system integrity issue)
   Scope: Production users affected
   Timeline: Immediate fix required
   Risk: System reputation and data safety

2. 🛡️ Safety Gate Override Analysis
   Normal: All tests must pass before starting work
   Emergency: Bug fix work allowed with failing tests (if fixing them)
   Override Justification: Critical system integrity issue
   Recovery Plan: Fix bug, then resume refactoring
```

**Framework Emergency Process**:
```
1. 🔄 Work State Management
   Current: REFACTOR-002 50% complete, tests passing
   Action: Stash current refactoring work
   Verification: Confirm system stable after stash
   
   Commands:
   git add . && git stash push -m "REFACTOR-002 WIP - emergency pause"
   make test  # Verify system stability

2. 🚨 Emergency Bug Fix Protocol
   Classification: CRITICAL BUG FIX (overrides all priorities)
   Scope: Minimal fix only - no refactoring during emergency
   Testing: Comprehensive tests for the specific bug
   Documentation: Minimal updates, focus on resolution
   
3. 🔄 Resume Strategy
   After Fix: Resume REFACTOR-002 from stashed state
   Integration: Consider if bug fix affects refactoring approach
   Validation: Ensure emergency fix and refactoring work together
```

**Decision Outcome**: **Emergency Override** with controlled process

**Emergency Implementation Steps**:
```
Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (0-2 hours)
1. Stash current refactoring work
2. Identify bug root cause in original formatter.go
3. Implement minimal fix for data corruption
4. Add specific tests for the bug scenario
5. Verify fix resolves corruption without side effects

Phase 2: Emergency Validation (2-4 hours)
1. Run full test suite
2. Test with real-world data scenarios
3. Update only critical documentation (bug fix notes)
4. Deploy fix to production

Phase 3: Work Resumption (4+ hours)
1. Analyze if bug fix affects refactoring approach
2. Resume REFACTOR-002 from stashed state
3. Integrate bug fix learnings into refactoring
4. Complete refactoring with improved understanding
```

**Learning Points**:
- Framework allows emergency overrides with controlled process
- Critical system integrity issues override normal workflow
- Emergency work should be minimal scope to reduce risk
- Clear resumption plan prevents work loss
- Bug fix learnings should inform ongoing refactoring

### **Scenario 9: Cross-Team Dependency Conflict**

**Context**: EXTRACT-003 (formatter) depends on design patterns not yet established by architecture team

**Raw Request**: "I'm ready to start EXTRACT-003, but the architecture team hasn't finalized the template engine patterns we need. Should I wait, implement with best guess, or propose patterns myself?"

**Decision Framework Application**:

#### **Dependency Analysis**:
```
1. 🔗 Blocking Dependency Assessment
   Hard Block: Cannot proceed without pattern decisions
   Soft Block: Can proceed with assumptions and refactor later
   
   Analysis: Template engine patterns affect:
   - Public interface design
   - Internal component boundaries  
   - Error handling integration
   - Performance characteristics

2. 📋 Stakeholder Impact
   Architecture Team: Setting patterns is their responsibility
   Current Work: EXTRACT-003 is critical path for extraction phase
   Downstream: EXTRACT-004, 005, 006 depend on EXTRACT-003
   Timeline: Extraction phase has committed deadlines
```

**Framework Decision Process**:
```
1. 🎯 Goal Alignment Check
   Project Goals: Component extraction phase completion
   Timeline: Extraction phase deadline pressure
   Quality: Proper architecture patterns required
   Coordination: Cross-team collaboration needed

2. ⚡ Urgency vs Important Matrix
   Urgent + Important: Extraction timeline AND architecture quality
   
   Options:
   A) Wait for architecture team (preserves quality, risks timeline)
   B) Proceed with patterns (preserves timeline, risks rework)
   C) Collaborative approach (balances both concerns)

3. 🔧 Collaborative Solution Design
   Proposal: Lead pattern design with architecture team input
   Process: Create pattern proposal, get rapid feedback
   Validation: Implement with explicit approval checkpoints
   Risk Management: Design for easy pattern refactoring
```

**Decision Outcome**: **Collaborative Leadership Approach**

**Implementation Strategy**:
```
Phase 1: Pattern Proposal (Days 1-2)
1. Research existing template engine patterns
2. Analyze EXTRACT-003 requirements thoroughly
3. Create pattern proposal document
4. Share with architecture team for feedback

Phase 2: Rapid Iteration (Days 3-4)
1. Implement prototype with proposed patterns
2. Get architecture team feedback on implementation
3. Refine patterns based on practical testing
4. Document final pattern decisions

Phase 3: Full Implementation (Days 5-10)
1. Implement EXTRACT-003 with approved patterns
2. Create pattern documentation for future extractions
3. Validate patterns work for downstream extractions
4. Update architecture.md with established patterns
```

**Risk Mitigation**:
```
Pattern Flexibility: Design interfaces to allow pattern changes
Feedback Loops: Daily check-ins with architecture team
Rollback Plan: Keep current formatter working during extraction
Documentation: Clear pattern rationale for future decisions
```

**Learning Points**:
- Framework enables proactive problem-solving for dependencies
- Cross-team collaboration requires structured communication
- Taking initiative with expert input balances speed and quality
- Risk mitigation plans are essential for dependency conflicts

## 🎯 Edge Case Handling

### **Scenario 10: Framework Guidance Conflicts**

**Context**: Decision framework itself provides conflicting guidance

**Raw Request**: "The decision framework says to prioritize extraction work (current phase), but also says to fix failing tests first (safety gates). We have a non-critical test failure in an extraction-unrelated component. What takes priority?"

**Decision Framework Meta-Analysis**:

#### **Framework Hierarchy Validation**:
```
1. 🛡️ Safety Gates Analysis
   Test Failure: "Non-critical test failure"
   Impact Assessment: 
   - Does it block CI/CD? 
   - Does it affect extraction work?
   - Is it in a critical component?
   
   Finding: "Non-critical" suggests it doesn't block other work

2. 📋 Framework Layer Precedence
   Layer 1: Safety Gates (absolute)
   Layer 2: Scope Boundaries  
   Layer 3: Quality Thresholds
   Layer 4: Goal Alignment
   
   Question: Does "non-critical test failure" violate Layer 1?
```

**Framework Interpretation Process**:
```
1. 🔍 Safety Gate Definition Clarification
   Original: "All tests must pass (make test)"
   Intent: Tests that block development work
   
   Non-critical test failure analysis:
   - If make test passes overall: Not a safety gate violation
   - If make test fails: Safety gate violation regardless of criticality
   - Individual test failure in isolated component: Context-dependent

2. 🎯 Precedence Rule Application
   If make test fails: Fix immediately (Safety Gate override)
   If make test passes: Apply normal priority system (Goal Alignment)
   
3. 🔧 Framework Clarification
   Safety Gates apply to: System-level blocking issues
   Individual test failures: Evaluated through full 4-tier hierarchy
```

**Decision Resolution**:
```
1. Run System Test: make test
   
   If FAILS: 
   → Safety Gate violation
   → Fix immediately regardless of component criticality
   → Test failures block all other work
   
   If PASSES:
   → Apply normal decision hierarchy
   → Non-critical component test can be prioritized normally
   → Extraction work takes precedence per current phase
```

**Framework Improvement**:
```
Clarification Added: Safety Gates apply to system-level blocking issues
Documentation Update: Distinguish system tests from individual component tests
Example Addition: Add this scenario to framework documentation
Meta-Learning: Framework itself needs iteration and clarification
```

**Learning Points**:
- Framework hierarchy provides resolution for conflicts
- "Non-critical" requires specific definition in context
- Framework documentation needs edge case examples
- Meta-analysis of framework helps improve its guidance

### **Scenario 11: Validation System Circular Dependencies**

**Context**: DOC-014 decision validation requires documentation that doesn't exist yet

**Raw Request**: "The decision framework validation is failing because it expects documentation sections that we haven't created yet (like this training guide). But we need the validation to pass to implement the framework. How do we break this circular dependency?"

**Circular Dependency Analysis**:

#### **Dependency Chain Mapping**:
```
1. 🔄 Circular Loop Identification
   DOC-014 Subtask 6: Requires validation to pass
   DOC-014 Validation: Requires Subtask 7 documentation
   DOC-014 Subtask 7: Requires working validation framework
   Validation Framework: Requires Subtask 6 completion
   
   Loop: Subtask 6 → Validation → Subtask 7 → Framework → Subtask 6

2. 🔍 Minimum Viable Breaking Point
   Options:
   A) Implement basic documentation first (bootstrap approach)
   B) Make validation tolerant of missing documentation
   C) Implement framework without validation first
   D) Create documentation stubs, then enhance
```

**Framework Resolution Process**:
```
1. 📋 Bootstrap Strategy Selection
   Chosen: Option D (Documentation stubs + incremental enhancement)
   
   Rationale:
   - Maintains validation integrity
   - Provides incremental improvement path
   - Documents requirements clearly
   - Allows testing at each stage

2. 🔧 Implementation Phases
   Phase 1: Create minimal documentation stubs
   Phase 2: Implement basic validation with stubs
   Phase 3: Enhance documentation iteratively
   Phase 4: Strengthen validation as documentation improves
   
3. ✅ Validation Tolerance Levels
   Phase 1: 60% validation success acceptable
   Phase 2: 80% validation success target
   Phase 3: 95% validation success target
   Phase 4: 100% validation success required
```

**Bootstrap Implementation**:
```
Documentation Stubs Created:
- decision-framework-usage-guide.md (basic structure)
- decision-framework-troubleshooting.md (outline)
- decision-framework-training-examples.md (templates)

Validation Adjustments:
- Warning for missing sections instead of errors
- Progressive validation requirements
- Clear roadmap for completion

Enhancement Schedule:
- Week 1: Complete usage guide
- Week 2: Complete troubleshooting guide  
- Week 3: Complete training examples
- Week 4: Full validation requirements
```

**Learning Points**:
- Circular dependencies require bootstrap strategies
- Incremental implementation with progressive standards
- Framework flexibility needed during development
- Clear roadmap prevents getting stuck in loops

## ❌ Anti-Pattern Examples

### **Anti-Pattern 1: Safety Gate Bypass**

**❌ Wrong Approach**:
"The tests are failing but I need to implement this feature urgently. I'll skip the test requirements and fix them later."

**Why This Is Wrong**:
- Violates non-negotiable safety gates
- Creates cascading test failures
- Introduces technical debt with unclear repayment plan
- Violates framework hierarchy

**✅ Correct Approach**:
1. Stop all feature work
2. Fix test failures first (BUG FIX Protocol)
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Then proceed with feature work

**Framework Learning**:
- Safety gates are absolute, never conditional
- "Urgent" doesn't override safety requirements
- Test failures always block new development

### **Anti-Pattern 2: Scope Creep During Implementation**

**❌ Wrong Approach**:
"While implementing GIT-004 (submodules), I noticed the Git error handling could be improved. I'll enhance that too since I'm already in the code."

**Why This Is Wrong**:
- Exceeds documented feature scope
- Mixes NEW FEATURE with MODIFICATION work
- No planning for the additional error handling work
- Violates scope boundary discipline

**✅ Correct Approach**:
1. Complete GIT-004 as documented
2. Create separate feature ID for error handling improvements
3. Follow MODIFICATION Protocol for error handling
4. Keep changes cleanly separated

**Framework Learning**:
- Scope boundaries prevent well-intentioned scope creep
- Each change needs its own feature ID and protocol
- "Since I'm here" is not valid justification for scope expansion

### **Anti-Pattern 3: Priority Inversion**

**❌ Wrong Approach**:
"I know EXTRACT-002 is marked as ⭐ CRITICAL, but I'm more familiar with the testing code, so I'll work on TEST-INFRA-002 instead."

**Why This Is Wrong**:
- Ignores documented priority system
- Personal convenience over project needs
- May block other team members
- Violates goal alignment principles

**✅ Correct Approach**:
1. Work on highest priority task available (EXTRACT-002)
2. If knowledge gap exists, invest time in learning
3. If truly blocked, document barriers and escalate
4. Respect priority system established for project success

**Framework Learning**:
- Personal preferences don't override project priorities
- Priority system exists for good reasons
- Knowledge gaps are opportunities for growth
- Framework enforces discipline over convenience

### **Anti-Pattern 4: Documentation Avoidance**

**❌ Wrong Approach**:
"The code is self-documenting and I added good comments. I don't need to update specification.md or architecture.md for this change."

**Why This Is Wrong**:
- Violates documentation cascade requirements
- Creates documentation drift
- Breaks traceability system
- Ignores protocol requirements

**✅ Correct Approach**:
1. Follow protocol documentation cascade exactly
2. Update all required context files
3. Add/update implementation tokens
4. Use ai-validation CLI to verify compliance

**Framework Learning**:
- Documentation requirements are not optional
- "Self-documenting code" doesn't replace system documentation
- Protocols exist to prevent documentation drift
- Traceability requires explicit documentation links

### **Anti-Pattern 5: Framework Shopping**

**❌ Wrong Approach**:
"The decision framework says I should work on extraction tasks, but I think the testing infrastructure is more important right now. I'll use my own judgment instead of the framework."

**Why This Is Wrong**:
- Undermines framework adoption
- Creates inconsistent decision-making
- Ignores collective planning and prioritization
- Reverts to ad-hoc decision making

**✅ Correct Approach**:
1. Follow framework guidance consistently
2. If framework seems wrong, challenge it systematically
3. Propose framework improvements through proper channels
4. Use framework to guide decision making, not personal preferences

**Framework Learning**:
- Framework adoption requires consistent usage
- Personal judgment should work within framework, not around it
