# Enforcement Mechanisms

## Automated Validation Rules

1. **Feature ID Consistency**
   - All implementation tokens must correspond to feature matrix entries
   - Tokens must match feature IDs in feature-tracking.md
   - Token descriptions must align with feature descriptions

2. **Cross-Reference Integrity**
   - All document links must resolve correctly
   - Feature references must be valid across all context files
   - Implementation tokens must link to correct feature entries

3. **Status Synchronization**
   - Feature status must be consistent across all documents
   - Implementation status must match documentation status
   - Test coverage status must align with implementation status

4. **Test Traceability**
   - All features must have corresponding test references
   - Test coverage must be documented in testing.md
   - Test descriptions must match feature requirements

## Manual Review Requirements

1. **Context Documentation Review**
   - Every code change must include review of context file updates
   - Changes must be reflected in all relevant context files
   - Documentation must be updated before code changes

2. **Feature Impact Assessment**
   - Verify that all affected features are properly documented
   - Check cross-document consistency for affected features
   - Update all relevant context files for impacted features

3. **Immutable Requirement Check**
   - Confirm no immutable requirements are violated
   - Verify backward compatibility constraints
   - Check against immutable.md requirements

4. **Backward Compatibility Verification**
   - Ensure changes preserve documented compatibility
   - Verify no breaking changes for existing users
   - Document any necessary migration guidance
