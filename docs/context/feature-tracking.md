# Feature Tracking Matrix

## 🎯 Purpose
This document serves as a master index linking features across all documentation layers to ensure no unplanned changes occur during development.

> **🤖 For AI Assistants**: See [`ai-assistant-compliance.md`](ai-assistant-compliance.md) for mandatory token referencing requirements and compliance guidelines when making code changes.
> 
> **🔧 For Validation Tools**: See [`validation-automation.md`](validation-automation.md) for comprehensive validation scripts, automation tools, and AI assistant compliance requirements.

> **🚨 CRITICAL NOTE FOR AI ASSISTANTS**: When marking a task as completed in the feature registry table, you MUST also update the detailed subtask blocks to show all subtasks as completed with checkmarks [x]. Failure to update both locations creates documentation inconsistency and violates DOC-008 enforcement requirements.

## 📊 Implementation Status Summary

See the detailed [Implementation Status](implementation-status.md) for comprehensive progress tracking of all refactoring and extraction tasks.

#### **RISK MITIGATION**
- **Parallel Refactoring**: REFACTOR-001, 002, 003 can proceed in parallel with coordination
- **Incremental Validation**: REFACTOR-006 validates each step to prevent compound failures  
- **Rollback Plan**: Each refactoring step includes rollback procedures if validation fails
- **Extraction Gate**: Hard stop before extraction until all criteria met

**🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH REFACTORING PHASE IMMEDIATELY**

The codebase has excellent test coverage (73.5%) and comprehensive testing infrastructure, making it ideal for safe refactoring. The pre-extraction refactoring will ensure:
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-defined component boundaries
- **Maintainable Code**: Reduced complexity and improved organization  
- **Reliable Extraction**: Zero risk of circular dependencies or architectural issues
- **Future-Proof Design**: Extracted components will be robust and reusable

**Start with REFACTOR-001 (Dependency Analysis) immediately to begin the foundation for successful component extraction.**
