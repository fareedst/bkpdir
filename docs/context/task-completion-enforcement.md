# üö® Task Completion Enforcement for AI Assistants

## üìã Overview
This document tracks the implementation and placement of the critical enforcement note for AI assistants regarding task completion consistency in documentation.

## üéØ Critical Note Content
```
üö® CRITICAL NOTE FOR AI ASSISTANTS: When marking a task as completed in the feature registry table, you MUST also update the detailed subtask blocks to show all subtasks as completed with checkmarks [x]. Failure to update both locations creates documentation inconsistency and violates DOC-008 enforcement requirements.
```

## üìç Placement Locations

### ‚úÖ Primary Enforcement Documents

#### 1. `docs/context/ai-assistant-protocol.md`
**Placements**: 4 locations

- **Line 398**: After post-change validation checklist  
- **Line 406**: In "After Code Changes" priority section
- **Line 427**: In AI assistant mandatory compliance section

**Strategic Importance**: This is the main protocol document that all AI assistants must follow for code changes.

#### 2. `docs/context/ai-assistant-compliance.md`
**Placements**: 2 locations
- **Line 180**: In AI enforcement rules section
- **Line 239**: In mandatory AI validation checklist

**Strategic Importance**: Primary compliance document with rejection/approval criteria for AI assistants.

#### 3. `docs/context/feature-tracking.md`
**Placements**: 2 locations
- **Line 9**: Near top of document after AI assistant guidance
- **Line 42**: After mandatory enforcement section about context updates

**Strategic Importance**: The actual feature registry where tasks are tracked and marked complete.

### ‚úÖ Supporting Enforcement Documents

#### 4. `docs/context/context-file-checklist.md`
**Placements**: 2 locations
- **Line 30**: In feature-tracking.md update guidance
- **Line 208**: In final AI assistant checklist

**Strategic Importance**: Guides AI assistants on which files to update and provides final validation checklist.

#### 5. `docs/context/validation-automation.md`
**Placements**: 1 location
- **Line 500**: In mandatory rejection criteria section

**Strategic Importance**: Contains validation automation requirements and rejection criteria.

## üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement Integration

### DOC-008 Compliance Integration
The critical note is integrated with the DOC-008 comprehensive icon validation and enforcement system:

1. **Rejection Criteria**: Added to mandatory rejection criteria in multiple documents
2. **Approval Criteria**: Added as requirement for approval in validation documents
3. **Validation Checklist**: Added as critical item in AI assistant validation checklists
4. **Cross-Reference**: Links task completion consistency to DOC-008 enforcement requirements

### üö® Enforcement Mechanisms

#### Automatic Enforcement
- **Validation Scripts**: Integration with existing DOC-008 validation infrastructure
- **Documentation Consistency**: Cross-references with icon validation system
- **Rejection Criteria**: Explicit rejection criteria in ai-assistant-compliance.md

#### Manual Review Points
- **Pre-Change Validation**: Required check in ai-assistant-protocol.md
- **Post-Change Validation**: Required verification in final checklists
- **Task Completion**: Explicit requirement when marking tasks complete

## üìä Coverage Analysis

### Complete Coverage Achieved
